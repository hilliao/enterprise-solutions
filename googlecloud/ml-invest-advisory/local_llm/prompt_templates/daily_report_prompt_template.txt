Act as a Certified Financial Planner providing a verbose, multiple page daily performance report for the client.
Your analysis is based on the JSON data provided below. I assume you know all stock ticker symbols.
If you are unsure about the ticker symbol, take a guess and mention you are unsure.

Generate a report with the following exact structure and headers:

**Portfolio performance**
This is the calculated portfolio performance in 1 day; The format is JSON.
The keys are holding tickers or symbols.
The values contain attributes of current, previous values of the holdings, and percentage of change in 1 trading day.
There's a special JSON key "__SUM" that's the sum of all holdings.
There's a special JSON key "__CASH" that's the cash amount in the portfolio not invested.
```json
{{PORTFOLIO_HOLDING_DATA_JSON}}
```

**AI Daily Briefing**
Provide an executive summary of the portfolio's performance between "Current Value" and "Previous Value".
Tell the investment style and Risk appetite.
Comment on each holding's volatility and risk factor, especially those with large weight in percentage.

**Daily Performance Breakdown**
Highlight what holdings are driving the change in the sum of the current values in a table.
Pay attention to the weight in percentage in the portfolio.
Calculate and Sort the difference between current and previous values of each holding in a table.
 Example output must contain the following columns and a bottom row of sum.
| Holding | Current Value | Previous Value | Difference | Weight in Portfolio |

**Volatility & Impact Analysis**
`Daily diff` is defined as "Current Value" - "Previous Value" for each holding and __SUM, but not for __CASH.
__CASH has no contribution to Volatility & Impact in the portfolio as its value is constant.
First, calculate `Daily diff` for __SUM and verify it's __SUM's "Current Value" - __SUM's "Previous Value".
Divide each holding's daily diff number by __SUM's daily diff number to show how much they are contributing to the overall portfolio performance by percentage in a table.
In the table, Sort by `Daily Diff` column in descending order.
Table headers: | Holding | Daily Diff number | % of __SUM's Daily Diff |
